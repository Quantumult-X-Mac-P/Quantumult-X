## Overview

<a href="#">Quantumult X</a> delivers advanced network proxy management enabling sophisticated traffic routing configurations. The application serves privacy-conscious users, network administrators, and power users requiring granular connection control.

Policy group organization enables quick switching between different routing strategies for varying scenarios. Users maintain separate configurations for different locations or purposes selecting <a href="#">appropriate groups</a> based on current needs.

Traffic rule granularity determines connection routing based on destinations, applications, or custom criteria. Rule-based management enables sophisticated routing decisions matching <a href="#">specific requirements</a> precisely for different traffic types.

JavaScript scripting extends functionality beyond built-in capabilities through custom code. Advanced users implement specialized routing logic or request processing accommodating <a href="#">unique requirements</a> beyond standard features.

Connection statistics track bandwidth consumption and traffic patterns providing network activity visibility. Usage monitoring reveals application network behavior identifying <a href="#">bandwidth-intensive</a> operations informing optimization.

Configuration profile management enables quick switching between complete setups for different contexts. Travelers maintain location-specific profiles while professionals separate <a href="#">work configurations</a> from personal settings.

DNS customization controls domain resolution through alternative servers or rules. Custom configuration affects connection performance and <a href="#">privacy characteristics</a> for security-focused users.

Automatic fallback handling maintains connectivity despite individual failures through server switching. Connection resilience ensures continued operation when specific <a href="#">proxies fail</a> temporarily.

Multi-protocol support handles HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, and Shadowsocks accommodating diverse types. Universal compatibility consolidates management within <a href="#">single interface</a> regardless of infrastructure.

Performance optimization minimizes latency overhead maintaining responsive connections. Efficient implementation preserves network speed despite <a href="#">routing complexity</a> for demanding applications.
